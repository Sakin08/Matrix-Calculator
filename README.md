# Matrix-Calculator

# 1.Introduction
The Matrix Calculator project aims to create a versatile and user-friendly tool for performing various matrix operations. Matrices are fundamental in numerous fields, including mathematics, physics, computer science, and engineering. This project will provide a platform to perform operations such as addition, subtraction, scalar multiplication, matrix multiplication, transposition, and determinant calculation.

# 2. Objectives
The main objectives of the Matrix Calculator project include.

 Matrix Operations: 
Implement functions for basic matrix operations, including addition, subtraction, scalar multiplication, matrix multiplication, transposition, and determinant calculation


# 3. Features
The Matrix Calculator will include the following features:

 1. Addition and Subtraction: 
Perform addition and subtraction of two matrices.

2. Scalar Multiplication: 
Multiply a matrix by a scalar.

3. Matrix Multiplication: 
Multiply two matrices.

4. Transposition: 
Calculate the transpose of a matrix.

5. Determinant Calculation: 
Find the determinant of a square matrix.

6. User-Friendly Interface: 
Provide a clear and interactive interface for users to input matrices and select operations.


# 4. Deliverables
The project will be delivered as a Python script with the following components:

1. Matrix Calculator Module: The core module containing functions for matrix operations.

2. User Interface Module: A module handling user input, interaction, and displaying results.

3. Code Repository: The project will be hosted on a version control system (e.g., GitHub) for collaboration and version tracking.
